This project ended up being two games, 
an impossible pong where the goal is to survive as long as possible.
The other game is some strange variant of breakout.

During the development of this project I have suffered alot from technical difficulties, 
mainly that eclipse crashes constantly on my system (lubuntu).
I have therfore mainly been working with a simple text editor for editing and eclilpse only for running.
Strange errors like not being able to create new Activitys in eclipse forced me to use and old
computer with a Windows 7 OS. Here eclipse was stable, but I was unable to run the project
on a physical device. This all resulted in a very tedious and slow workflow where I had 
to switch computer for what I needed to do. I would estimate that atleast 75% of my time
spent on the project was wasted on thecnical problems instead of actually programming.

In this project I have learned the following.

Creating buttons and make them usefull
Edetting xml and setup necesarry things in the project
Switching activitys
Accessing the view components of an Activity
Using GLSurfaceView to use OpenGL 2.0
The fundamentals for setting up and work OpenGL 2.0 including
	Create vertex and fragment shaders
	Creating a OpenGL program
	Linking it all togheter
Using vertex attributes to put data so that the shaders can access it
Learned to use uniforms variables
Drawing triangles with the help of vertices
Controlling the color of the fragments/pixels
Using an ortographic projection matrix so solve the different screen size problem
and more...
